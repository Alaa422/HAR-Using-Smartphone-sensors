# HAR-Using-Smartphone-sensors
 HUMAN ACTIVITY RECOGNITION USING SMARTPHONE SENSORS
Data mining Final_Project
This project demonstrates how to predict the type of physical activity (e.g., walking, climbing stairs...) from tri-axial smartphone accelerometer data using supervised machine learning. Smartphone accelerometers are very precise, and different physical activities give rise to unique patterns of acceleration.
Data was collected from experimentation carried out by group of 30 volunteers ,can be freely downloaded from the UCI Machine Learning repository. 
Each person was supposed to perform six activities (Walking, walk up, walk down, Laying, Standing and Sitting). They had used embedded sensors of Smartphone to collect data. Dataset was loaded into Python as .csv file.
